# Implementation Changes from Original Plan

## Technology Stack Changes

### TypeScript Instead of Python
The original plan mentioned Python with FastAPI and Pydantic, but the implementation uses TypeScript with Express and Zod for the following reasons:

1. **Better Frontend Integration**: TypeScript provides a more seamless experience when integrating with frontend frameworks like React or Vue.

2. **Type Safety**: While Python with type hints is good, TypeScript's static typing offers more robust type checking at compile time.

3. **Zod for Validation**: Zod provides similar functionality to Pydantic but is native to the TypeScript ecosystem, allowing for better integration with the codebase.

4. **NPM Ecosystem**: The JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem has robust libraries for working with Alpaca's API and WebSockets.

### Directory Structure
The implemented directory structure differs from the original plan to better align with TypeScript/Node.js conventions:

```
alpaca_api_service/
├── .vscode/                      # VS Code configuration
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── api/                  # API controllers and routes

└── README.md                     # Project documentation
```

## Feature Implementation Changes

### Artificial Orders
The artificial order system has been implemented as a core feature rather than just a component of the order engine. This provides better separation of concerns and allows for more flexibility in how artificial orders are managed.

### Market Hours Definition
Specific market hours have been defined:
- Pre-market: 4:30 AM to 9:30 AM Eastern
- Regular market: 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern
- Post-market: 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM Eastern

These hours are used to determine when artificial stop and stop-limit orders should be used instead of regular orders.

### Configuration Structure
The configuration has been structured into two main categories:
- `runtime`: Settings that can be changed without restarting the service
- `startup`: Settings that require a service restart to take effect

This provides clearer guidance to users on which settings can be safely modified while the service is running.

### API Response Format
The API response format has been simplified to remove unnecessary nesting. Instead of:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

The API now returns the data directly:

```json
{ ... }
```

This makes client-side processing simpler and reduces payload size.

## Additional Features

### WebSocket Server
A WebSocket server has been implemented to provide real-time updates for:
- Order status changes
- Position updates
- Market data

This allows clients to receive updates without polling the API.

### Graceful Shutdown
The service now implements graceful shutdown to ensure that no data is lost when the service is stopped.

### Health Check Endpoint
A health check endpoint has been added to allow monitoring systems to verify that the service is running correctly.
